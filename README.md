#DATA STRUCTURES SOLTIONS 


The solutions for Data Structures Using C and C++ (2nd Edition) 2nd Edition by Yedidyah Langsam (Author), Moshe J. Augenstein (Author), Aaron M. Tenenbaum (Author)

I plan to do every excercise in the book if possible using C and some minimal C++. This will take some month to complete.  
All solution will have a build.bat which can run to compile the code.
